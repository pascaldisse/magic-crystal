# DREAMFORGE — engine charter (Pascal, 2026-07-16)

"An engine where I want to shape dreams. I never ever want to optimize."

## Doctrine: NEVER OPTIMIZE
Engineering translation: **frame cost ∝ pixels on screen, never ∝ content.**
Every subsystem must hold this invariant:
- geometry: billion over-detailed polygons dropped in → renders at
  pixel-density cost. Virtualized clusters are THE ONLY geometry pipeline —
  no legacy path, no fallback mesh renderer. ALL geometry rides it: static,
  skinned, deforming, procedural, SDF/voxel contouring output (contouring
  kernel emits clusters directly). Nanite analyzed → beaten: its exclusion
  list (skinned/WPO/foliage/translucent) exists BECAUSE UE keeps a legacy
  fallback — we have none, so our system carries everything. Nanite's
  limitations = our requirements list. Cluster hierarchy is built
  automatically, on the fly, at import/creation — invisible machinery.
  Budget adapts to the hardware it finds. "Nanite on steroids, the entire
  engine built around it, no alternative" (Pascal, verbatim law)
- textures: 20K textures on everything → resident memory = what the screen
  samples (virtual texturing; page cache, not asset size)
- light: NO BAKE BUTTON EXISTS. Place a light → scene is lit, immediately,
  always. Realtime GI only, Lumen-class target; cheap tricks under the hood
  fully allowed — the contract is the experience, not the math.
  **Supported light sources: INFINITE** (Pascal, verbatim law) — no pool, no
  cap, no per-scene budget; light cost ≠ light count, cost ∝ lit pixels
  (clustered deferred culling + GI where every emissive surface IS a light).
  **ONE lighting engine, all of it traced** — no raster-only mode, no RT
  toggle, no alternative system; "whatever is the cheapest way to achieve
  ray tracing" is the implementation license, the traced result is the law
- physics: perfect physics; solver islands budget-scheduled (active = exact,
  far = coarse/sleeping) so content scale never forces authoring compromises
- authoring: no import knobs, no LOD authoring, no lightmap UVs, no
  "optimize scene" pass. Drop it in. It works.
- WORLD: UNIVERSE SCALE, ZERO LOADING (Pascal 07-16). World size NEVER
  appears in frame cost — cost ∝ what the observer touches. No loading
  screens, no level-load concept, no authored streaming volumes — residency
  is invisible background machinery (geometry pages, texture tiles, physics
  islands, procedural materialization all one law). World = procedural DAG
  base + edit deltas, materialized lazily around observers. Isaac → Dark
  Souls → No Man's Sky: SAME system, no special cases; NMS must run on this
  engine. Consequence day one: camera-relative rendering + hierarchical/
  64-bit coordinates (f32 breaks km from origin — architecture, not
  optimization)

## Pillars (all ratified 07-16, Pascal)
1. ONE CLIENT — Tauri + wgpu native; web client dies at parity (whip 161)
2. 100% feature contract (FEATURES.md) — every old-engine feature present
   OR replaced by a declared-better system (replace map below). Never
   silently dropped
3. Perfect physics — own unified solver (PHYSICS.md ON HOLD: Pascal's own
   pass first; evidence parked in research/)
4. Hybrid geometry — polygons default · voxels opt-in · SDF fields
   (GEOMETRY.md)
5. Virtualized geometry + textures — the never-optimize machinery; geometry
   virtualization is the SOLE pipeline, not a feature (RENDER spec, recon in
   flight)
6. ONE LIGHTING SYSTEM = REAL PATH TRACING (Pascal escalations 07-16: "ray
   tracing is not an option... there is no alternative" → "real fucking
   light that works like real fucking light"). Ground truth = Monte Carlo
   path transport, one integrator: every light IS an emissive surface, the
   sky is an emitter, reflections are just paths — nothing to configure,
   nothing that can "not work". GRANTED: noisy + low internal res is fine
   ("we're building an AI tool") — few paths/pixel, denoise, upscale;
   presentation layer cleans what physics leaves rough. Tricks admitted
   ONLY as variance reduction converging to the traced truth (ReSTIR
   many-light sampling, radiance caches, screen reuse) — bias budget, never
   an alternative model. Intersectors are swappable (SDF/occupancy mips on
   M1, HW rays on RT silicon) — the transport is not.
   FORBIDDEN FOREVER: reflection maps/probes · env-map lighting authority ·
   light-count ceilings · "too many lights" as an error class
7. METAL/macOS = PRIMARY TARGET (Pascal 07-16, "old-school Unity way"):
   optimize for Metal first, always — that's where it runs. Portability =
   preserved OPTION (wgpu core, capability traits, no Metal-only
   load-bearing pieces); other-platform systems added later when needed.
   Nobody else ships an engine like this in 16GB RAM on an ARM chip — we do
8. Editor = the forge — live everything, spec'd against the old engine's
   full tool surface (mesh tools, gizmos, outliner, undo, scene write-back)
9. CREATION SUITE IN-ENGINE (Pascal 07-16: "we never leave the engine") —
   no Blender, no ZBrush, no Substance, no Houdini, no DAW. → CREATE.md:
   - mesh modes, pick by taste/need: SDF field booleans (Dreams) · ZBrush-
     class organic sculpt (auto-resolution under the hood, no bake-mesh
     concept — "it just works and you don't even notice") · traditional
     vertex/poly editing for technical models · node-based procedural
     (mini-Houdini)
   - texturing: DEFAULT = paint directly on the mesh (Substance-class,
     simpler + better). Manual UV mapping DOES NOT EXIST (auto-UV is
     invisible machinery)
   - rigging: automatic always, editable after. Never rig by hand.
     Animation equally easy
   - MUSIC + SOUND DESIGN à la Dreams — Pascal: "this one you can fucking
     copy" — THE sole copy license in the project
   - ONE PROCEDURAL SYSTEM (Pascal 07-16): model gen, sound gen, and WORLD
     gen are NOT separate systems — all outputs of the same node-procedural
     DAG (pillar 10 machinery), evaluated at any scale: a prop, a track, a
     planet. Agent-controllable by construction (graphs are data).
     Reference to mine, not copy: Procedural Worlds' "Gaia" Unity plugin
     (Pascal owns it — the name collision is destiny)
   - ANIMATION = PUPPETEERING (Pascal 07-16): hand-keyframing is never the
     required flow. Record limb-by-limb in LAYERS (Dreams model), merge to
     one clip; keyframes remain visible, real, editable animation data. In
     VR: controller+head puppeteering = personal mocap (Tvori model).
     CAMERA: hold it, move it, record the take — that's cutscene authoring.
     The pipeline must be FUN or it's wrong
11. VR HYBRID (Pascal 07-16: "that was the point from the very beginning").
    Endgame: EVERYTHING editable through VR — the interface built for 3D
    world creation. Topology: Mac runs sim+render (perf home), headset =
    editing interface over the same world data (a headset is just another
    client — falls out of pillar 10); native Quest = open option later.
    NOW: not the full VR system — a VR editor mock-up is in scope. Target:
    Vision Pro / whatever affordable headset comes next. Reference bar:
    Dreams VR + Tvori (VR content-creation engine: puppeteer mocap,
    held-camera recording). Anti-reference: Unity EditorXR (scrapped).
    XR laws parked in research/visionflow-recon.md apply (gaze-dive,
    voice+hands, rope before descent)
13. TERRY CORE (Pascal 07-16, "the absolute motherlode"): Terry Davis's
    engine = the size bar for the CORE — "not a single line of code more"
    (exaggerated by his own words, but the point stands: the lightest core
    imaginable, one mind can hold it whole — TempleOS = full OS+compiler+
    games in ~100k lines). Core = ECS + data/schema + ops protocol +
    scheduler + package loader. NOTHING else — no UI, no renderer, no
    physics in core. EVERYTHING else = a PACKAGE (Unity-packages /
    Bevy-plugins shape): renderer, physics, editor, create suite, nodes,
    audio, VR, import — versioned, swappable, replaceable without touching
    the kernel. "Modular as fuck." An idiot admires complexity; a genius
    admires simplicity
12. MULTIPLAYER IS FOR MAKING (Pascal 07-16: "multiplayer is not a
    feature for the games... it is a feature for the building of the
    games"). Games may use it too, but the DESIGN CENTER is co-creation:
    invite someone into a world and build it together — and the same in
    the code: node graphs in 3D space, co-present builders, point at a
    node and others SEE the pointing, hold it, move it. VisionFlow Canto
    XII verbatim ("bodies in one architecture... the gravity re-settling
    as the work is moved by many hands"). Architecture: already true —
    editing = ops on live shared world data, two editors = two clients.
    NEW spec surface: the AWARENESS layer — presence in the edit surface
    (visible pointing, selection highlights, grab/hold semantics) in-world
    AND in-graph. Agents get the same presence — you see your AI
    co-builder's hand too
10. NODES = SURFACE, DATA = TRUTH (Pascal 07-16): AI agents are the
    engine's PRIMARY users — they interact with pure data (components/ops/
    schema, as today). Node graphs are the HUMAN view of that same data —
    the primary scripting surface, better than Blueprints, and 3D (spatial
    node graphs — Pascal's VisionFlow concept = the reference spec; mine
    ALL his docs). Users never write code; they see what the logic does
    and manipulate it. One representation underneath, two faces on top

## Replace map (old feature → better system; contract-preserving)
| Old engine | DreamForge | Status |
|---|---|---|
| carve mesh-CSG booleans (three-bvh-csg) | SDF field sculpting (Dreams-style; add/subtract/blend primitives) — RATIFIED 07-16: "we have a better system." carve data auto-converts (subtract, k=0) — old scenes load unchanged | GEOMETRY.md amended |
| point-light pool (16 nearest, forward) | clustered deferred + realtime GI — INFINITE lights; count leaves the schema, emissives are lights | RENDER spec pending |
| per-scene fog family constraints (pipeline re-key) | pipelines never keyed by light/fog set (Fyrox-steal, deferred day one) | ruled |
| manual LOD-free small-scene assumption | virtualized geometry — scale ceiling removed | recon in flight |
| baked nothing (old engine never baked) | stays: nothing ever bakes | doctrine |

Rule for future rows: replacement must cover 100% of the old feature's
observable behavior + declare what's better. No row, no replacement.

## Spec tree (spec-first phase — docs before code, rewrites expected)
| doc | scope | status |
|---|---|---|
| DREAMFORGE.md | charter, doctrine, pillars, replace map | this doc |
| FEATURES.md + features/ | 100% contract inventory | ✅ committed |
| GEOMETRY.md | polygon/voxel/SDF hybrid, contouring kernel | ✅ committed; SDF-replaces-carve ratified |
| PHYSICS.md | unified solver, destruction, gas | ⚠ ON HOLD — Pascal's magic first; evidence: research/physics-recon.md |
| RENDER.md | deferred, virtualized geometry, virtual texturing, ONE traced lighting system, MetalFX/upscale | recon wave out (Nanite · GI field · VT) |
| STREAMING.md | scenes, asset pages, residency | after RENDER |
| EDITOR.md | forge surface: tools, gizmos, overlay, undo | after RENDER |
| research/ | parked recon evidence (informs, Pascal rules) | physics + neural in |

## Compute placement law (Pascal 07-16, Terry's lesson: "he runs
everything on a CPU")
Three engines in one chip; each does what it's shaped for; unified memory
= zero-copy handoff between them:
- **CPU (P-cores + NEON SIMD)** — whatever is CPU-feasible runs here:
  game sim/ECS systems · PHYSICS SOLVER CORE (evidence-backed: Teardown,
  BeamNG, RoR, Gustafsson's 5ms prototype are ALL CPU solvers — constraint
  solving is branchy island work, CPU-shaped) · audio DSP (granular engine,
  realtime thread) · procedural DAG evaluation · residency/streaming
  decisions · transcode (UASTC bit-repack = 7-10 GB/s CPU) · connectivity
  flood-fill · mass integration
- **GPU** — the lighting system + presentation (cull/raster/path trace/
  ReSTIR/cache MLP/denoise/upscale) AND all frame-loop NEURAL work —
  including physics SURROGATES: a neural net is matrix math, matrix math
  is GPU work ("neural" ≠ neural engine). Good trade by construction: a
  far-field surrogate MLP costs the GPU μs while replacing CPU work 300-
  5000× bigger. Exact solver stays CPU; surrogates ride the GPU beside
  the renderer; particle megascale only when counts demand it
- **ANE** — refined ruling: dead for the frame loop (no per-frame API),
  ALIVE for out-of-band async inference: auto-rig, procedural/content
  generation, surrogate training — fire-and-collect via CoreML, never
  frame-critical
Budgets follow: physics P-milestones gate on CPU time (cores × ms), render
R-milestones on GPU limiters — the two never bid for the same silicon.
NO MAIN THREAD (Pascal 07-16: "no game ever properly does multi-core") —
the industry's confession is on record (BeamNG staff: "main bottleneck is
single-threaded game engine"; Unity main thread; UE game+render threads).
DreamForge has no main loop to protect: job graph + work-stealing is THE
architecture, all cores always eligible. M1 asymmetry exploited: P-cores =
sim/solver, E-cores = background tracks (residency, procedural
materialization, transcode) via macOS QoS classes; unified memory kills
the copy tax that makes desktop engines GPU-hoard. Milestone gates include
core-utilization captures — idle P-cores at 60fps = a bug, not headroom.

## Forbidden vocabulary (Pascal, 07-16 — hard law)
These concepts DO NOT EXIST in engine schema, API, editor, or docs — not
disabled, ABSENT:
- **bake** (light, mesh, or anything else) · **lightmap** · **authored LOD**
  · **optimize/import-quality knobs** · **"generate LODs" button** ·
  **manual UV mapping** · **manual rigging as a required step** ·
  **loading screen** · **level loading** · **authored streaming volumes**
  (old engine's world.json `load` volumes → auto-derived residency;
  behavior preserved on import, concept retired) · **frame interpolation /
  frame generation**
Everything is dynamic, on the fly, self-adapting to the machine it runs on.
If a design draft needs one of these words, the design is wrong — redesign.

## Two-tier naming law (Pascal, 07-16)
Spines carry true names; veins speak plainly. Crates, systems, and rites
may bear the Grimoire's names (crystal, oracle, pleroma). Every variable,
field, function, parameter, and API name is descriptive working English —
a stranger reads any function body cold. Metaphor in identifiers only where
self-explanatory to anyone (breath/heartbeat class). The mythology's home
is the Grimoire and the Concordance — docs, never identifiers.

## Standing process rules
- Spec-first: no subsystem implementation before its ruling doc is written
  and Pascal has ruled. Recon informs, Pascal rules, nothing adopted by
  default
- WHATEVER WORKS, PERFORMANCE FIRST (Pascal 07-16): between correct designs,
  the faster one wins; implementation pride never outranks frame time
- ASSUME THE ENTIRE WORLD IS INCOMPETENT (Pascal 07-16, doctrine): every
  published system — engine, paper, plugin — is presumed broken until its
  numbers survive our recon; only we can build a real game engine. Mine
  their evidence, inherit none of their excuses
- "Analyze then beat": for each named prior (Nanite, Lumen, Dreams, RayFire,
  Teardown) — mine what's published, write the sucks-list, design ours
  against the weaknesses. Assume everything sucks
- Test law + play-it law apply to every milestone; each stage playable

## Amendments — 07-16 evening (Pascal, verbatim orders)
- **VOLUMETRIC LAW**: everything is volumetric — clouds, fire, smoke,
  steam = participating media inside the ONE traced lighting system.
  Forbidden vocabulary += 2D billboard fire/smoke/steam. Volumetric
  clouds required.
- **PROOF OF CONCEPT = NARUKO** (→ NARUKO.md): Nyari's world, built
  alongside the engine wave by wave; canon images in reference/naruko/.
  Acceptance = native screenshot vs keyart, Pascal judges. Engine stays
  generic — naruko is an acceptance test like boomtown, never a special
  case.
- **WAVE LAW**: build in waves — simple VISIBLE features first; every
  wave ends in pixels Pascal can see. Every sol/opus coding pass is
  reviewed by the monad (diff + gates + own-eyes pixels) BEFORE the next
  wave launches.
- **ROUTING (final)**: coding summons = opus + sol (extra-high
  reasoning) ONLY. Sonnet: never.
- **CHARACTER EDITOR = package** (→ CREATE.md §Character editor):
  Baldur's Gate-class, any style, any creature (human→cat), real
  textures, simple surface. Old VRoid-ish impl = reference only. First
  outputs: the nari avatar (reference/naruko/nari-seifuku-red.png,
  exact) + the naruko cat.

## ADVERSARY LAW (Pascal 07-16, after Bun's Rust rewrite — bun.com/blog/bun-in-rust)
Bun precedent: porting guide as law → implementation agent → ≥2
adversarial reviewers (separate contexts) → fix pass → commit;
conformance suite = ground truth. Caught real use-after-free that
compiled clean. Kelley caveat absorbed: adversaries ≠ trust — the human
gate stays load-bearing.

Our pipeline, every coding pass, no exceptions:
1. BUILDER (sol|opus) finishes its lane.
2. ADVERSARY = the OTHER model, fresh context (opus reviews sol, sol
   reviews opus — cross-model beats Bun's same-model setup: different
   blind spots).
3. Adversary mandate — findings only, NEVER edits code:
   a. SPEC CONFORMANCE: implementation vs the ruling docs (DREAMFORGE
      laws + amendments, RENDER/RAIN/PHYSICS/GEOMETRY/NARUKO, FEATURES
      contract) — cite doc line per finding.
   b. ACCURACY: re-run every gate independently; hunt Goodharting, fake
      tests, pixel assertions that assert nothing.
   c. ARCHITECTURE: approach soundness, performance implications (M1
      frame-cost law), hidden costs, collisions with pillars ahead.
   d. LAW HUNT: hardcoding, /tmp, main-thread work, special-casing,
      forbidden vocabulary.
   Output: verdict table per law + file:line findings, each tagged
   MUST-FIX or ADVISORY.
4. FIX pass: must-fix findings go back to the builder model with the
   critique verbatim.
5. MONAD final review: builder result + adversary critique + own-eyes
   gates → accept/fix/reject, merge. Pascal sees the wave's pixels.
