# Client feature inventory — FROZEN OLD-CLIENT PARITY LEDGER (never native target spec — spec-concordance item 14, 07-18)

Scope → every text source under `client/`; binary VRM/VRMA payloads listed as assets. Port note: `native Rust` → Bevy/wgpu/Tauri-side capability; `DOM overlay` → retained/rebuilt webview UI; `dies` → browser-only behavior with no native equivalent required.

| Feature | Source file(s) | What it does | client-rs port note |
|---|---|---|---|
| WebGPU renderer/bootstrap | `client/kernel/renderer.js` | Creates WebGPU renderer, scene, perspective camera, resize path, ACES tone mapping, shadowed sun/hemi lights, TSL bloom fallback. | native Rust |
| Render/post chain | `client/kernel/renderer.js`, `client/kernel/environment.js` | TSL scene-pass bloom; environment can set bloom strength/radius/threshold. | native Rust |
