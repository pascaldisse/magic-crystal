//! POSITION-BASED FLUIDS — the SPH smoothing kernels and the density-constraint
//! dials (Macklin & Müller, *Position Based Fluids*, SIGGRAPH 2013).
//!
//! The XPBD-native fluid: incompressibility is ONE constraint per particle,
//!
//! ```text
//!     C_i(p) = ρ_i / ρ₀ − 1 ,   ρ_i = Σ_j m_j W(‖p_i − p_j‖, h) ,
//! ```
//!
//! solved by the SAME positional-projection machinery as every distance bond
//! (a new constraint TYPE beside bonds/contacts — not a parallel system). The
//! two kernels are the paper's (after Müller 2003 "Particle-Based Fluid
//! Simulation"): POLY6 for the density estimate (smooth, its zero gradient at
//! r=0 keeps the density sum well-behaved) and SPIKY for the gradient (a
//! non-vanishing gradient near r=0 so close particles feel real repulsion —
//! poly6's gradient collapses there and lets particles clump).
//!
//! Every constant here is DERIVED from the support radius `h` by the kernels'
//! own normalisation integrals (∫W dV = 1 over the ball of radius `h`) — none
//! is a plucked literal (the never-hardcode law). The user dials are `h`, the
//! rest density `ρ₀` (calibrated, see the solver), and the three artificial-
//! pressure parameters, each a documented default.
